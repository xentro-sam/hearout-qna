# HearOut

HearOut is a Q&A website for students of [KIIT](https://kiit.ac.in/). Students can ask their queries on the website, having their fellow students to answer it.

This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
This website is created by me for my 6th Semester Minor Project for the fulfillment of my B.Tech degree in CSE.
